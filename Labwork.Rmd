# Course part 1 - Laboratory (Monday)

-   We selected and sub-cultured 20 isolates from the -80 freezer
    -   8 presumptive *Salmonella* spp. isolates
    -   6 presumptive *E. coli* isolates
    -   6 presumptive *Klebsiella* spp. isolates

# Course part 2 - Laboratory (Wednesday)

- The Vitek machine was run on Tuesday (three times due to problems with the control)
- For most isolates the results were fine on the last run
  - No ID; no bacteria or not able to identify
  - We have not correlated the number and species ID from the VITEK to what was entered on the plates (would be nice to have the presumptive species to compare)
